# This file contains all the parameters for training.
#
# The training tool parse this file in a rather simple way, so DO NOT use space in
# paths or filenames, and DO NOT mix comments with parameters.


# The root path of all training data. There should be a label file named "labels.txt" 
# which contains landmark labels for the training data. 
training_data_root: train

# How many landmarks for each face
landmark_count: 5

# The index of left eye center in landmarks. If there is no landmark for eye center 
# in the landmark configuration, choose one near eye center (e.g. eye corner)
left_eye_index: 0

# Same as above, for right eye center
right_eye_index: 1

# The output model file path and name (must end with ".xml.gz")
output_model_pathname: model.xml.gz


# Below are parameters of the model, you can refer to the paper I mentioned in 
# README.md to get a better understanding. If you don't quite understand, you
# can use the default value as below.

# The number of top-level stages
T: 10

# The number of bottom-level stages for each top-level stage
K: 500

# The number of random features generated for each top-level stage
P: 400

# The level of randomness for each feature. Must in range [0.01, 1]. Lower value 
# means features will be generated near the current guessed landmark positions.
Kappa: 0.3

# The F parameter of fern
F: 5

# Regularization coefficient
Beta: 1000

# The number of inintialization in testing. Lower value will speed up alignment,
# but may hurt accuracy
TestInitShapeCount: 5

# Data argumentation factor. Lower value will speed up training, but may hurt
# accuracy
ArgumentDataFactor: 20

# The number of vector basis for model compression
Base: 512

# The number of non-zero value in sparse coding for model compression
Q: 5
